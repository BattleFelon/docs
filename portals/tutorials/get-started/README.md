# Getting Started
Getting started is easy and free.  After signing up, you'll be walked through the steps to set up a Product, connect a device (or device simulator), and interact with device data on a dashboard.  Murano will then provide the steps to walk through cloning a Solution Application and deploying it - allowing you to interact with your device via a fully custom web application in minutes.
