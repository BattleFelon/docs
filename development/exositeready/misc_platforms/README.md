Synapse Wireless enabled development kits and reference designs.

## E10 and E20 SNAP Gateway Support
Exosite has worked with Synapse Wireless to create an evaluation kit based on Synapse's SNAP Connect E10 Gateway.  This E10 Gateway has an Ethernet connection and runs Linux in addition to internally having a SNAP RF Engine embedded in it so it acts as a gateway for a SNAP network to the Internet.

The evaluation kit is made up of a Synapse SNAPConnect E10 Gateway and two Synapse RF Engines running on protoboards in addition to some external sensors and LEDs.  The software for this evaluation kit can be used for any makeup of devices and is meant as an evaluation tool and reference code for your specific M2M and Internet of Things projects.
