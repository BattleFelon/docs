# Producs Overview

![murano overview](assets/platform_overview.png)

Murano Products allow developers to define and deploy devices under a common product model.  Products combines three key things:
* Device Connectivity
* Provisioning, including Device Identities and controlled Activations
* Product Definitions to define what resources devices have access to to read/write and interact with the platform
* Product Managed Content for infield updates, configuration files, and media file access
